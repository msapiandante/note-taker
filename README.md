# note-taker
## Description
I was tasked with creating application that would use an Express.js back end and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. We were provided starter code for front end. I continue to learn about computational thinking in that actions that I take for granted as obvious to the computer, are not. I continue to practice decomposition and abstraction. I am enjoying learning about back-end development. 

## Credits

Instructor Leif, TA Fred, my classmates-all helping me debug and continue to learn. 
My cat Pascal for reminding me to take breaks by stomping all over my keyboard.
